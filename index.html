I thought you were a million miles out of my league. I remember going to campus events every week and secretly hoping we'd match colors. And every time we did, I got so excited because it'd give me another reason to talk to you."
		},
		{
			image: "lake.jpeg",
			word: "crush",
			memory: "The formal was such a blast with you! You had so many reasons to not have fun - being sick and having your dress lost and all. Not to mention your date was a nervous wreck and wore a shirt that was way too bright. But, despite all that, you still laughed, danced, and encouraged everyone around you. You were too much fun to be with, and my cheeks almost hurt from smiling that night. It was then that I knew I had a big, fat crush on you."
		},
		{
			image: "roblox.png",
			word: "build",
			memory: "The COVID era of our friendship will always be a special time for me. This was when you started to have feelings for me after the few (hundred) dates I’ve taken you on, haha. It was so fun finding ways to connect with you over zoom and discord. And who could forget our cupids, Mezi and Jasper? Our night playing Mezi’s game together on Roblox was only a week after I found out you liked me, and by then I was already soaring."
		},
		{
			image: "visalia-one.jpeg",
			word: "float",
			memory: "This was the first time I saw you in person since quarantine, and it felt like I was floating through a dream. Seeing you in person was already crazy, but being able to play at the arcade, mini golf, and then finally confess my feelings for you before meeting your family for the first time was unreal and so much fun. Seeing your glowing smile after telling you I liked you was something I’ll never forget."
		},

			image: "ask-two.jpeg",
			word: "door",
			memory: "I think this was the most nervous I had been all that year! God opened so many doors for me to be able to ask you to be my girlfriend. I remember being so excited but also feeling so concerned that my plan would fail and you wouldn’t be surprised. But seeing your happiness after bringing you flowers, a fortune cookie, and all your close friends was an answer to so many prayers and made all the planning worth it. Without a doubt, I’m so lucky to be able to call you my girlfriend to this day."
		},
		{
			image: "love.jpeg",
			word: "love",
			memory: "I’ll always remember our adventure to the Sequoia’s, not only because we saw a bear, but because this was when we exchanged “I love you's”. I remember I physically couldn’t leave your doorstep without telling you those words. It was an amazing first to the many “I love you’s” since, and even though I got back to San Diego at 6 AM I still had butterflies. Holding your hand and hugging you for the first time as a couple also was a nice cherry on top, haha."
		},
		{
			image: "disney.jpeg",
			word: "magic",
			memory: "This was our first time going to Disney together, and it was magical. The whole park was engineered for couples to feel lovey-dovey and was I definitely feeling it. You were beautiful, the rides were fun, the friends were great, and the fire works were incredible. I wanted to kiss you so many times during that date, and I think I chickened out because I didn’t know how to do it. Either way, I wouldn’t have rather gone with anyone else."

I know that I’m probably not the best image to them, or the best boyfriend in their eyes, but they’ve shown me so much hospitality and care in making me feel welcome. Seeing the way that you love them, even when they test your patience, is also such a testament to the kind of person you are. You serve them, protect them, buy them gifts, and pray for them. Thank you for calling me higher in the ways that I need to love my own family."

Thank you for being my valentines this past year, and letting me be a bit of a simp, haha. I’ve loved every second I could bring you flowers, or buy you a gift, laugh with you, or bring you a meal, because you mean so much to me. To more valentines to come!"

			memory: "This was probably one of my favorite trips with the fiending five. To be honest, I used to be a little annoyed at how your roomies wanted so much of your time, and I thought I’d have only leftovers with you. But God has shown me the opposite. He’s used them to protect our relationship in so many ways. He’s used them to protect our purity, and to encourage you and build you up, even in times when I hurt you. Your roomies are such a gift to us, and I’m glad we get to share so many fun moments with them."

I know we joke about being 60-40, but Romans 12:10 says, “Be devoted to one another in love; honor one another above yourselves”. If that’s what 60-40 is, then I’d love to give that to you. I’d love to keep honoring you above me, whether I’m upset with you or lovey-dovey, whether tired or energized. Happy one year anniversary my love, I love you!"
